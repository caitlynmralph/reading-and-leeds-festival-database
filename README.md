# reading-and-leeds-festival-database

I spent (approximately) ~8,319 hours cataloguing every Reading and Leeds Festival lineup since 1999. To my knowledge, this has never been done before. The source of the posters is the <a href="https://www.readingfestival.com/history">Reading Festival</a> and <a href="https://www.leedsfestival.com/history">Leeds Festival</a> websites themselves (shout out to their documentation!).

As soon as I wrapped up the data portion of my Major Studio 1 project, they announced more acts for the 2019 lineup (and merged the two posters into one). There's an outstanding Github issue to address this.

For said project, I used this data to look at musician career arcs through their stage placement on the posters. I'll post a link here when I'm satisfied with the result.

This was an incredibly manual process, so please submit an issue if you spot an error!
